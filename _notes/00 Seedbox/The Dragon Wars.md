[[Children of Tiamat]] rose from their lairs in an effort to claim the [[Diamor Island]] as their domain, the dragons of [[Bahamut]] refused and the dragons fought their war primarily through their surrogates - [[The Dragonborns]] - whom the dragons created for this particular task, to fight their war. 

[[Tiamat]]'s children lost the war and retreated to the darkness of their lairs once more, those that survived.

# The Dragonborn
Dragonborn only survived if their sire survived, the bond to their [[dragon sire]] is the source of their lifestrength. If any dragonborn can successfully survive the death of their dragon sire, it is currently unknown.

[[The Dragonborns|Dragonborns]] have not been seen in civilization after the ending of the war. Even those that fought against Tiamat's children were not to be seen afterwards.
