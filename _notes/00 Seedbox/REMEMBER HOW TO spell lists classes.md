I had to do that as well

my solution was: export a spell list per class, turn that into [[links]]

so for example the Warlock spell list would be:

Warlock.md
[[Eldritch Blast]]
[[Sickening Radiance]]
etc..


I'd then select all the links and use the add links to current note plugin

[5:22 PM]
that'd add [[Warlock]] to every note within the spell list
[5:22 PM]
I then batch text replaced every [[warlock]] in the spell list folder to #warlock
