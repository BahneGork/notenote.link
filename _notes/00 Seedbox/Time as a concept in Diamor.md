# Time and the Eldari
The only beings to ever truely have been unaffected by [[time]] and [[causality]] are the [[elves]], [[eladrin]] and the [[celestial elves]] of the fey ancestry. Their special forests, wodes, are some of the last places on the material plane that are unaffected by these [[universal laws]].

The [[Eldari]] are members of chaos in the eternal struggle between [[law]] & [[chaos]], unlike the court of discord whom also serve chaos the Eladri view the chaos of nature as self-evidently good a power to serve in the struggle against civlization and law. Chaos is freedom, and growth. Discord, the [[court of all flesh]] is a corrupt mockery. Discord twists chaos into something evil and destructive in the eyes of [[Eldari]].
