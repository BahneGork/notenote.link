# option 1
As you are entering the inn's common room, Cedric is talking with the innkeeper about accommodation.

you see ... "table patrons" 

As you finish scanning the room heavy footsteps can be heard on the staircase to the upperfloor and possibly the inn's guest rooms.

Coming down the stairs you see a man in his mid-forties, clad in an almost black full plate adorned with red rims. His chest piece has a red triangle shield with a black leafless tree (dead). 

His hair has gone grey and his face looks weatherbitten and experienced. His light grey eyes seems joyous and his face generally kind. He is adjusting a glove and as he comes halfway down he says loudly "Thank you for your cooperation kind innkeep, these are troubled times we need to pay extra attention to detail." 

As he looks up from his glove and scans the room his eyes fall on your gathered group at the door "Ah, busy evening for the fallen star today". He walks over to the Innkeeper and four soldiers follow him down the stairs all clad in black and red with black scarfs covering most of their faces attached to their helmets. 

He hands the innkeep a coin purse "For your troubles and some furniture" then he looks around the room "Praise our glorious lord regent [[Baron Hexton]]" whirls a hand in the air and proceeds towards the door with his soldiers.

He stops at the pc's looks at them with a curious and appriciative look. "Allow me to introduce myself good sir's. I am [[Sir Claudio]], Knight of the Black lilly, servant of our Lord Regent, Baron Hexton. Whom do i have the pleasure of greeting? "

"We are searching for miscreants, insidious insurgents, would you believe there are people who oppose the Baron's rule? Those poor misguided fools, everyone knows the Baron is an extension of the King, if they oppose the Baron they oppose the King, the throne of Arendur and the glorious kingdom that is Ursia!" as he finishes the last words he looks around the room and ends with his gaze upon the heroes seemingly observing their reaction to his words.

"Well I shall not detain you further, we got business at the watch keep. Do seek out any of our the Baron's men should you come across any information regarding insurgents. Good night to you"
