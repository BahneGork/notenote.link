	- "i dont know any of the war plans, i am merely a messenger"
- unofficially Angel is interrested in [[The Shadow company]]'s structure, members, equipment and any other information. At the very least a meeting so he is aquainted with them, maybe steal some item from them for later divination.
- Angel is also interrested in any plans [[The Shadow company]] may have for activities in the Barony.
- Angel seems unworried about the goblins "dont worry about the goblins"
- Angel will seem positive and approvable of any plans so as not to awake suspicion
