# Josie Harrt and her past
[[Josie Harrt]] has a history and it followed her to [[Delios]], [[a criminal organisation from Josie's past]] has made contact with her and is blackmailing her to do something. They are threatening to reveal a dark secret to the citizens of [[Delios]] unless she lets the Abbesses run the girls and buy more girls from the organisation. What she doesnt know is that they have many brothels in their clutches like this. They could just get rid of her and take over, but nobody really wants to leave Arendur to live in Delios.
-	once a month the same stranger shows up to visit. He talks in private with Josie and one of the Abbesses, he doesnt lay with any of the girls. He goes by "[[Mister]]".
-	Eavesdropped conversations: 
	-	Josie conversations
		-	"I will remind you, we run this now, not you."
		-	"There will be a new clutch soon"
	-	Abbess conversations
		-	"how is the profit?"
		-	"any trouble with the lumber jackers?"
		-	"Is Josie behaving?"
		-	"[[The Sarah Girl]] & [[The Gilly girl]] we might need them soon, make sure they are ready. They dont work from now on." two weeks ago.
	-	[[Mister]] agenda:
		-	Sarah and Gilly are members of merchant families, [[The Ruby Throne]] paid to have them removed for awhile until their families complied and became members of the guild. The girls are being conditioned to spy on their family and possibly sabotage them if need be.
		-	The criminal organisation is taking all the profit of the brothel. Everyone gets a salary and nobody wants for nothing.
-	Girls who has been to [[Ranch Falca]] have bruises, but nobody reports being hit or beaten. The men were alittle rough, strong grips but nothing violent.
-	lumber jacks on [[Ranch Falca]] has more stamina than any regular customers
