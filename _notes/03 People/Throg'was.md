## “Throg’was”
[[Throg’was]] translates to “those who seek to regain our honor”
## what are they
the dwarves seeking the builder runes are an elite unit of moradin “hammers”, they are trying to conceal their “status” and blend in as travelling merchants trying to strike out away from Arendur trade. 
## questions
how does the pc's get more information about them?

they stopped by the monastery and sold an emerald necklace for provisions? information? information about what? and where did they go after?
