# Looks
Bald head, capped (maybe fused?) with a metal skull cap that bears a large dwarven rune etching "Sabrak Thurlagh" - *Flawed one in the fields of broken dreams*
She has ruby red eyes and more than one nasty scar in her face, a split lip, split eyebrow and missing the lower bit of her right ear.
She wears a golden nose ring that has a chain to her left ear ring, the top of her ears has a row of piercings as well.
Her arms are covered in tattoo's of dwarven runes, they are runes that name the various monster types she has killed (or helped kill).
She wears a kilt and metal shodded boots with some rather nasty spikes no doubt for delivering wicked gouging kicks.

# Personality
**Motivation** *Go out in a blaze of glory* find someone worthy of besting her in combat and putting her down.
**Trait** I made a terrible mistake in battle that cost lives and i would do anything to keep it a secret.
**Bond** Im only interrested in finding my deathdealer, getting paid to kill those unworthy of my death is a consolation.

# Notes
Currently owns a rather ancient and rare great axe, deffinently dwarven design, has dwarven runes and a dwarven makers mark that Brumor could recognize from [[Spike]] the sword [[Aurilia]] has now.
