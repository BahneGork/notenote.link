# Lord Davide and the Cautier school
[[Lord Davide]] is in town, he knows [[The Shadow company]] is coming through there soon or he hopes? 
- he wants to recognize them as a player in [[Ursia]], present his organisation as a possibly ally. They could be useful in the long run as a tool in the kingdom working for the interrests of [[The Cautier School]]. What can he offer?
	- tools
	- supplies
	- manpower?
	- mounts?
	- Deliver messages?
	- information about what? The organisation knows almost anything and wonder why they did not know about the red hand invasion preparations. [[Is someone actively using magic to cloak the redhands actions?]]
- Whose decision was it to disband the standing army of Arendur? the king? an advisor? [[When exactly was the standing army of Arendur disbanded]]?
- Someone has been killing agents of [[The Cautier School]] in [[Bedegaarn Barony]], [[Lord Davide]] is not publicly known as a member and he has a codename in communications. Whenever someone learned too much about red hand activity, [[Snikkter]] would either send an assassin, do it himself or ask the [[Daughters of Meg]] to send [[Sunkiller]].
		- [[Lord Davide]] has heard of this woman that [[Baron Hexton]] has put a bounty on. When investigating the deaths of some agents, her appearance has been mentioned. but not alot? she would be invisible?
		- [[Lord Davide]] would like to know if [[The Shadow company]] has met this woman and what they know of her. He believes that she is in charge of the goblins behind the killing of his agents and the old baron.
		- [[Lord Davide]] has also hired other investigators, who has found signs of goblin activity in some of the deaths. But they lead into [[blackwood]]. The last investigators [[The blue flame mercenaries]] hired was through a guild in [[Arendur]], [[The Fulcrom]]. They were sent into [[blackwood]] and was never heard of again. In truth this was suggested by a [[Ruby Throne double agent]] working in [[The Cautier School]], they saw an oppertunity to sow [[discord about the king]]. [[The blue flame mercenaries]] was also instructed to bring back goblin thropies for display.
- What are the company's current plans?
- "how can we help?"
