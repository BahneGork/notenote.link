# Avarthel - Teslions druid

Half-elf druid tending parts of [[blackwood]]

Nobody has seen him since the heroes climbed up out of [[sunken citadel]].

He went to help the forest that was calling and found that parts of the wood had been infested even though the [[Gulthias tree]] was destroyed the warlocks and the tree's presence had infected the woods and it began to take hold. Animals and fey in the mortal realm began losing control to the infection and the corruption began. 

The corruptions presence in the mortal realm weakened a feydark tunnel seal close by, enough that agents of Meg evil eye could slip through. 

Once the infection was inside Avarthel his mind slowly came under the influence of Meg and her warlocks and soon he opened a portal to the feywild and stepped through to aid their cause. To summon the unicorn and infect it.
