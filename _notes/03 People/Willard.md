He is gruff, normally keeps his nose to himself.
Knows how not to ruffle the officials feathers and still not sell out.
He hears more than he lets on and knows many locals.
He brews pickle hooch.
He knows about the Starsong hill elves, does not know their location.

He believes devils live in the click claw moors.
THE necromancer passed by shortly before the pc's

I see omens in every event and action, the saints are trying to speak to us, we just need to listen.
I will help those in need if i can and the personal risk to myself is low.
I take care of myself, no one else will.
