**Fey Ancestry.** Trellara has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic canâ€™t put her to sleep.

**Mask of the Wild.** Trellara can attempt to hide even when she is only lightly obscured by natural phenomena.

**Song of Rest.** Trellara can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize her wounded allies during a short rest. If she or any friendly creatures who can hear her performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

**Bardic Inspiration.** As a bonus action on her turn, Trellara can choose one creature other than herself within 60 feet who can hear her. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one weapon damage roll, ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. Trellara can use this feature a 3 times. She regains any expended uses when she finishes a long rest.
