## Running the party    
-   If the PCs have a specific goal with the party, figure out 3 ways they can do it.
    -   examples    
    1.  What happens the first moment the pc's show up?
        -   immediately attracts attention?
        -   who is visible?
        -   any major announcements?
        -   something big n loud going on?
        -   anything subtle going on that can be noticed?
        -   Generally this is the first event in the main event sequence
    2.  From then on, put the various toys into play in different configurations.
        - Guest list
			-   Which Npc's are talking to each other? 
        	-   Who might come over and join a conversation with the PCs ?
        -  Conversations (What are people talking about?) 
			-   topics of conversation
            -   splitting up is encouragable.
            -   cutting back and forth is good for pacing and crossovers.
            -   Keep social groups circulating.
                -   dont use everything on an npc in 1 interaction.
                -   Revisit, get back to npcs and conversation topics
        -   Mark off the first time an NPC has been interacted with
    3.  Allow pcs to observe things that they can choose to react to. Instead of having every npc come up to them, allow them to notice them walking past or overhearing them talking in a group.
        1.  Ask PCs what they want to do - no answers? trigger next event.
        2.  if things are lagging cut to other pc or the next main event.
