*Sabrak Thurlagh* equals something along the lines of "The flawed ones in the fields of broken dreams". 
A dwarven saying that refers to those who once had honor but did something so horrible that they could not bear it and take upon themselves the **oath of broken dreams**, to go into the world and seek their death at the hands of a capable executioner.
