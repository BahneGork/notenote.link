## [[Ranch Falca]][[Family Martelli]] 
~~They buy slaves from the slavetrader[[keyleigh dufaigh]], which they then give to the [[Lord Vermil]] in exchange for some of his blood which [[Ramon Chartrand - Alkymist]] turns into [[worker elixirs]] for the lumberjacks that work on the farm. ???~~
### [[The Vampire Spawn]]
[[Ramon Chartrand - Alkymist]]  put together enough circumstancial evidence to believe there was a vampire in the area of [[Delios]] He convinced his employer [[mace Martelli]] that they should try to caputre it, with it's blood he could create a powerful elixir for the lumberjacks to increase their productivity. 
- They began looking for a vampire hunter, as discreetly as possible. 
- The hunter helped them set up a trap, using the ranch little livestock supply. 
- But the hunter was deadset on killing, that would not do so once the trap was planned and set the ranch people turned on the hunter and used him for bait instead. 
- The trap worked and now the [[vampire spawn]] is kept in the middle of a cave that has a natural opening above it. 
	- They have constructed a sort of shadow shield raised above the vampire spawn so as to create a well of sunlight around it. 
	- It is bound with garlic infused ropes, 
	- staked with garlic infused wood and 
	- wrapped with heavy chains around its feet. 
- So now they need someone loyal enough to keep watch and they need to feed it. 
- The Rancher finds some unsavory mercenaries to stand guard and they feed it livestock. 
- [[worker elixirs]]
- The efficiency has in turn increased the amount of lumber cut down, which is starting to anger the druid circle that works with the lumber ranches to make sure things are in accord. 
- Some of the lumber is afflicted by a curse from the vampire spawns blood, whenever a lumberjack cuts or scrapes himself and spills blood on the land or wood.
