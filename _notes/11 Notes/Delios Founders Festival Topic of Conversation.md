-   *Recent monumentous event:* **The moon knight relieved Taernu of its occupation, she killed a giant and brought it's head back to Bedegaarn.**
    -   **viewpoint 1:** Where did the giant come from and why was it in Taernu? that sounds weird, could this be a publicity stunt by the new baron to gain popularity for his knights ?
    -   **viewpoint 2:** Good thing the new knight order are so capable, things have been getting darker over the last few years. The old knights were nowhere near as powerful and the while the old baron was kind he was resting on status quo
    -   **viewpoint 3:** I dont care what that moon knight does, she is arrogant and sadistic scum, should never have gotten a knighthood title.
-   *Political debates*: **The new baron has raised taxes, apparently war is brewing with the neighbor barony.**
    -   **viewpoint 1:** if it keeps us safe vs. why should we pay for the politics of barons
    -  **viewpoint 2:** is it not enough we send off our sons to die vs. claiming the other barony would benefit us all
    -   **viewpoint 3:** is there really a war vs not all nobles are "evil greedy warmongers"
