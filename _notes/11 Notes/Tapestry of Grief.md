# Tapestry of Grief
A well made, but neglected tapestry. Shows signs of age. 
It depicts several mounted men fighting blue skinned savages with large tusks.

One armoured knight is very clear, his shield emblazoned with a black eagle, shown beneath a black oak tree. He is being impaled by multiple polearms, mid-air pulled off his mount.

**History**
DC 12: There was a black eagle knight who was Duke in Arendur about 50-60 years ago.
DC 12: The black eagle knight was killed in battle about 55 years ago
DC 14: The black eagle knight's wife was said to have died from grief not long after.
DC 15: She became known as the lady of sorrow and was rumoured to have magical powers of her fey ancestors. She was supposedly half-fey.


**Perception passive**
DC 12: Something about the leaves of the tree is off.
DC 14: The threads are super delicate, not coarse and ruff.
DC 15: it's like some of the threads in the tree leaves are different than the rest of the tapestry, different texture and origin altogether.

**Investigate**
DC 17 or detect magic: Tree leaves: some of the leaves form the shape of elven runes, woven with Ithildin silk.
DC 17 Arcana AND elven: **"you that come after, approach and see, where mine black eagle was slain beneath the tree"**

If the words are read, the tapestry seems to blur and shimmer for a second, the runes disappear and nothing else happens.
