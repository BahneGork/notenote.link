## Call for action
A mounted knight is making a fallback ride towards the black oak, circling preparing to charge into a group of 3 **Large** blue orcs with long white tusks clad in plate armor, shields and polearms. On the ground near the knight lies 5 bodies, perhaps his retinue, a few horses lie whinnying in the grass as well while others have run away.
The fight scene is roughly 200feet away when the heroes come into view of it.

When the heroes come within 50-100feet one of the 3 juggernaughts will break off and head them off.

###### Opponents
Juggernaughts - large hulking plate wearing mounds of muscle and red eyes burning with intense heat it seems. Where their skin is visible it's blue, with white warpaint.

- [x] **Investigation** *smith* **(intelligence)** **DC 12:** those plate armor were pieced together crudely from many different armors. It's not pretty, but effective enough. Those armor pieces are human made.

## Move on
When all orcs are dead and it seems the Duke will survive, the air will ripple and shimmer in soft rainbow colors like soapy water and [[The Inexorable Time]] will manifest in a blinding light with the words *"No, this effect you cannot uncause"*
- *"The forms must be obeyed"* - *"This Causality is done"* 
A metallic automaton shaped like a wheel with spokes made of arms that grasp the wheel and spins it endlessly.

When anyone gets within 15 feet of TIME they feel strange, alittle sloggy, out of sorts. Like they are missing an edge in combat.. no bonus actions or reactions.
