Roadside chapel "haudh Ninlaith" Chapel of [[the sorrowful lady]]

The air smells sad and carries a faint wiff of lavender.

A small mausoleum stands not far from the road, a small trail leads to it. It is overgrown and not very well kept. The entrace has a statue of an elven maid on each side. The interior is one room 20 feet by 20 feet, on the left hand side stands the stone sarcophagus of the lady, on the right side is an empty space. Four braziers held ontop of iron rods (7 feet tall) burns with a soft glow. On the wall opposite the entrace, between the two alcoves hangs the [[Tapestry of Grief]].  

The walls are decorated with carvings of vines, trees and foilage. 

In the middle of it all is a 4 feet high stone pillar topped with a metal brazier. 
Religion DC 12: where people can burn offerings while saying a prayer. 

The entire place appears somewhat neglected or cared to by absolute minimal effort.

Stone sarcophagus of the lady, half fey wife of [[Duke Armatage Volantis]] known as [[The black eagle knight]]. The Duke died 55 years ago and his wife the lady passed not long after from grief. Being half-fey the family has erected the mausoleum upon their marriage as the lady wished to rest near her ancestors and her husband loved her too much to say no. It is the only Mausoleum of the [[Volantis family]] that does not reside inside [[Arendur]]

She refused to eat or speak when he died, instead she spent all her time weaving a tapestry. Some say she wove it with her own hair and the day she died was the day she finished the tapestry. The tapestry became known as the [[Tapestry of Grief]] and now hangs in the Crypt/Mausoleum.

If the secret elven runes woven into the tapestry is read, Time travel magic is envoked.

An hour after on the road the party will encounter the scene from the tapestry and have a chance to save the knight of the black eagle.

If the savage orcs attacking the black eagle knight is defeated before they can kill the duke, [[The Inexorable Time ]]([[ubønhørlige]])  will appear proclaiming hos causality must be adherred to and will try to kill the Duke and the Characters.

Encounter: [[The black oak fight]]

If the party successfully changes the course of time and saves the duke, he thanks them heartily and gives them (one of the characters) a Dukal ring as a sign of his appriciation and says if they ever need something, *"just bring me the ring and your request. With this rings, wherever you go, you go with the blessings of my house."*
Then the black eagle knight and his retinue fade away.
