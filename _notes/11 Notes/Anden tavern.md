Related: [[Misty Falls]], [[blackwood]],[[Bedegaarn Barony]]

# Building
The building is not in the best of shape, but it holds up for the most part.
There is a common room with 6 tables, 1 bar, 2 exits: kitchen and backroom.

This is a tavern, a drinking hole, they do not offer rooms.
For room n board they refer you to either [[Black portrait inn]] or [[Osric's Gold button]], barons and nobles stay at the button, merchants and the like stay at the portrait. People down on their luck can spend the night in the common room at "Anden" for free provided they dont make a mess and are gone before noon.
"Anden" does not have a stable either.

The 3 people who runs the tavern also live on the 1st floor, there is a stairwell in the back room that goes to the 1st floor.
