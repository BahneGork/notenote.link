in [[Bedegaarn Barony]], close to [[Teslions]]. Ruins of an old keep was swallowed up by a giant sinkhole many years ago, remains of it is scattered in a few caverns underground. One of which holds the teleportation circle of an ancient empire, the floor is tilted due to the collapse. Old pillars and signs of strutctures are scattered throughout. A large tunnel has been dug out from the teleportation room to the surface at a slight angle to allow caravans and such to enter and exit. The tunnel leads to a large stable built next to a manor, the stable floor is a giant hatch with a pulley system. The sinkhole gorge has been walled up with walls of stone.
