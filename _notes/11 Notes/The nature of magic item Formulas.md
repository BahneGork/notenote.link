A formula handout is a condensed abbriviated version of the ingame thing.

In game it is more like a collection of notes, schematics, calculations, experiments etc.. They might even be encoded or written in personal shorthand. It's technical and often requires proficiencies. It takes time to study and understand, may require experimentation to confirm a translation or decoding. It is not a simple math equation, it's a step by step cooking recipe. It is an arcane process, a ritual.
