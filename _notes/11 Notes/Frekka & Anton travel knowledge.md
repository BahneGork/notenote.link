## White Tusk clan
A clan of orcs in the mountains between [[Ursia]] & [[Akacia]] has got themselves a new leader who is more cunning and sophisticated than other Orc bloodchiefs. These orcs plot and scheme, their leader [[Bonebreaker Dorokor]] is a crafty and strategic warrior whose might is often mentioned by the other orcs. [[The white tusk tribe]] has been known to negotiate, but not above taking what they want.

Latest news is that [[Bonebreaker Dorokor]] is paying for information about something called [[The Sanguineous Oriflamme]]. Her trusted right hand [[Oregg Steeltwister]] even left her side to go looking for clues in [[Ursia]].

## Takaarn Merchants
Takaarn merchants are using the 200 year truce to make money, they frequently travel to Ursia and Akacia with goods from [[the great Karakurum]] (The eastern coast of Takaarn, where the great Khan city also lies.)

## points of interrest
### magic workshop 
You've heard rumours of a noble sponsoring a magic workshop up in the southeast mountains in Ursia. Some wizard managed to convince him to sponsor his research with promises of profit.

### Taernu
Taernu was besieged by wolf riders, a stone giant and a fire breathing flying monster.

### Teslions
You met a some survivors fleeing [[Teslions]] from the east, the town was evacuated under threat of a goblin horde set on sacking it. Most left for [[Arendur]] to the north. The town council was forewarned by a group who called themselves [[The Shadow company]]. 

### Baron Hexton
The old Baron was killed when an elven witch invaded Bedegar keep with her goblin minions and slaugthered the whole family. Lord Hexton, a good friend of the Baron stepped up and took over and kept order in the barony. While order is maintained, it is done so by force and hard discipline. Passing through Bedegaarn a forthnight ago you heard that the Baron is cracking down hard on the criminals, especially the Thieves guild "The Clock". But who can argue with being at odds with criminals?
	The Baron has granted knight titles to a former band of mercenaries and formed a new knightly order [[The black lilly knights]]. They number 4 knights, The Moon knight, The Tear knight, The Thorn knight (nickname blackrose by the commoners), The Ashtree knight. Of these The Thorn Knight is the most feared and loathed, The Moon knight a close second. The Ashtree knight is the most respected, but still feared, he is rumoured to be the most just of them all. The Black Lilly knights are extensions of the Baron's will, where they travel they are judge, jury and most of them also the executioner.
The Baron has been mustering units for his Army for some time.

### Blackwood
The [[blackwood]] is home to many dark things, if rumours, gossip and old wives tales are to be believed. Over the last 3 years the area around [[Blackspear ruins]] has turned into a swamp, rumours persist of a dragon living there. Some dragons could possibly twist the landscape with their presence, maybe there is truth to those rumours.
