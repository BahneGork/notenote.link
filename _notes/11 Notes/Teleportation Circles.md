# The teleportation system
Various [[Teleportation Circles]] exists around [[Diamor]] and the tower has found a few and activated them, but not all.

The Tower lacks a complete map of the entire system and each circle has to be manually and locally activated and found first.

# Located Activated Circles
- [[The Tower]] 
- [[Ashmar Downs]] - near [[Teslions]], half a day
- [[Kvalec]]

# Located but not Activated Circles

# Un-discovered Circles
- [[blackwood]]
