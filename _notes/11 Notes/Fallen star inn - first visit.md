## Patrons
### Table 1
Conversation overheard: [[Duerif Redblade]] "not to worry boys, im more than willing to see if any troublemaker here is the one destined to put me in the ground."
- [[Oscar Bonaccorsi]] & [[Shaw Hammett]] are talking low among themselves while eyeing the rest of the inn's patronson their way to Teslions with goods (general store), nobody at the Inn has heard of the sacking yet, this is all news to them. 
	- motivations: profit.
	- traits: 
		- Oscar: I keep multiple holy symbols and invoke whatever is useful at a given time.
		- Shaw: I fall in love easily, always trying to woo the prettiest in the room.
- [[Duerif Redblade]] a female dwarf also heading to [[Teslions]] tagging along with [[Oscar]] and [[Shaw]]. A [[double headed greataxe]] is always within reach, it looks ancient. *Intelligence Smith DC 18 "the design and edge reminds you of tales of the great weapon smiths of Clan Stronghollow, of which a small group were the ones who established the realm of Khundrukar also known as Glitterhame."* [[Duerif]] found this weapon in the posession of a group of goblins that she tore to pieces on the road to [[Akalane]] south of [[Blackwood]]. She knows nothing of smithing, she is an [[Sabrak Turlagh]] (warhammer slayer) and seeks to die at the hands of a worthy monster opponent.

- maybe there's an ongoing wager about .. uhm... who dares to hold their hand on it for the longest
- there are strange runes on the meteor that show it's no natural thing.
- LATER: githyanki and mind flayers alike seek it out 
- LATER: two different nobles heard the meteor is a huge gemstone and came to dig it up, and they both brought their men-at-arms
