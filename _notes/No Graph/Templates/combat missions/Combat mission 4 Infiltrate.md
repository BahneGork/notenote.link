### Mission 4: Infiltrate

_“Mission impossible…_

#### Mission Success

The party makes their way to a location by disabling foes quickly and remaining undetected.

#### Mission Failure

-   The enemy raises an alarm or communicates the presence of intruders to the larger force.
-   The party calls too much attention to itself – they don’t avoid enemy detection or dispatch enemies within one round of encountering them.

#### Encounter Elements

-   Include one small encounter or a series of small encounters with weak monsters that can be knocked unconscious or killed quickly.
-   Include terrain features such as pits, cliffs, and bridges where monsters can quickly be eliminated from combat.
-   Include mechanisms and items that can be used as mass communication devices, such as gongs or signal fire towers, guard dogs, horns or whistles, or intruder-sensing magical alarms and wards.

#### Tactics

-   Enemies want to raise the alarm first and fight second.
-   Most of the combat consists of small windows of opportunity for the PCs to creatively and quickly thwart the enemies from raising the alarm.

#### Twists

-   The enemy has been tipped off. They set a trap or ambush at the target location, and allow the party to infiltrate their way to the hazard.
-   The target location is not what the party expected. Illusion magic masks its qualities. Or the person or item (see Acquire) they expected to find is no longer there.
