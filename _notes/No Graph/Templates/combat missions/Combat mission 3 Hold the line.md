### Mission 3: Hold the Line

_â€œWe are the 300!_

#### Mission Success

The party defends a location from enemy attacks for a period of time, protecting a location or chokepoint and preventing enemies from getting past them.

#### Mission Failure

-   The enemy breaks through the line onto the location.
-   The enemy takes control of the location or proceeds past it towards the next target.

#### Encounter Elements

-   Include monsters with multiple movement modes, such as a climbing, burrowing, the ability to ignore treacherous terrain, and flight.
-   Include siege weapons, on both sides, as appropriate.
-   Include an opportunity for the party to prepare for an incoming enemy force, using the extra time to manage their gear and resources and identify ideal positioning points in the area. For example, the party fashions make-shift defenses or traps out of their gear and the natural materials and furnishings around them, or positions scouts and snipers in high and defensible locations.

#### Tactics

-   Enemies will attempt to overrun the chokepoint with concentrated attacks, trying to break the line.
-   The combat will be a test of endurance, forcing the party to adapt to bolster areas where they are taking heavy damage.

#### Twists

-   The location is unexpectedly flanked or attacked by an additional force of flying creatures later in the combat, forcing the party to protect more entry points and cover more ground.
-   A valuable item (see Acquire) is in the center of the location the party is defending.
