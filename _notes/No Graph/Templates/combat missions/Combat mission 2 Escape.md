### Mission 2: Escape Destruction

_“We’re not gonna make it!_

#### Mission Success

The party outlasts or survives an area and time period of massive natural or magical destruction – all while fighting an enemy and competing for safe routes out of the area.

#### Mission Failure

-   The party is unable to exit the devastated area in time.
-   The party is captured by the enemy, or is badly hurt, buried alive, or killed by the devastation.

#### Encounter Elements

-   Include monsters with multiple movement modes, such as a climbing, burrowing, or the ability to ignore treacherous terrain.
-   Include treacherous terrain or hazards, such as rockslides, avalanches and magical storms.

#### Tactics

-   Enemies will look to force PCs into dangerous terrain or hazards.
-   They will seal off or attempt to block exits they take.
-   The combat will be a series of brief skirmishes covering a lot of ground, moving towards exits.

#### Twists

-   The devastation can be stopped with a spoken magical key word, found in ancient scripts on a wall slab or in a prior encounter.
-   One or more enemy creatures may attempt to help the party escape, taking them to a safe area or to a place where they might be able to slow or stop the destruction, such as a mechanism or the ancient script riddle.
