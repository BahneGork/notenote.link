### Mission 1: Acquire

_“You have something we want…_

#### Mission Success

The party locates and seizes a valuable object in the area.

#### Mission Failure

-   The party is unable to locate or take possession of the object.
-   The enemy takes the item from the area or the item was moved from the area earlier.

#### Encounter Elements

-   Include monsters that hamper or punish mobility, making the acquisition of the object challenging.
-   Include enemy escape plans and routes should the party get too close to the object.
-   Include treacherous terrain or obstacles such as wards and traps that surround and protect the item.

#### Tactics

-   Enemies will move and attack to intercept and delay any PC advancing upon the object.
-   They will also funnel the party into the most dangerous paths to the item at every opportunity, such as shoving the characters into the pool of bubbling acid that surrounds a ghostly treasure chest whose secret contents the party seeks.
-   The combat will be dominated by enemy attempts to protect, escape with or even destroy the object.

#### Twists

-   The object is worn by or grafted to the skin of a creature, making this more than a simple item retrieval mission.
-   The item is much larger and heavier than expected, making normal means of taking or carrying it impossible.
