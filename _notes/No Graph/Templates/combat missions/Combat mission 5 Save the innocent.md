### Mission 5: Save the Innocent

_“We’re their only hope…_

#### Mission Success

The party rescues hostages or prisoners, saving their lives and returning them to safety.

#### Mission Failure

-   The party is unable to save the hostages or prisoners in time.
-   The enemy takes the hostages to a different location or kills them.

#### Encounter Elements

-   Ensure monsters are in position to easily harm or outright kill hostages or prisoners. For example, include a few monsters standing right over helpless or unconscious victims.
-   Include physical barriers, such as prison cells, cages, and manacles, for the party to have to deal with while trying to rescue the victims as quickly and as safely as possible.

#### Tactics

-   Enemies will look to harm or kill their prisoners or hostages first and directly fight the party second.
-   The combat will likely play out with the party first targeting foes that endanger the prisoners or hostages the most.
-   Enemies will use the hostages as shields, to slow party pursuit, or as bargaining chips if the party starts to win.

#### Twists

-   The prisoners or hostages are in a mobile prison, such as a prison cart, meaning some of the monsters might take off with the cart or send it careening over the nearby cliff edge during the fight.
-   Some of the prisoners or hostages are capable fighters, and once freed, help the party kill or drive off their captors.
