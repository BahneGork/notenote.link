At the beginning of the round, check for collapsing ranks.

Commanders take turns in initiative order.  
Commanders activate their controlled units on their turn.

During an activation,
the unit regains its reaction.
Then, it takes damage from tokens.  Remove one token of each type.

You have a move, an action, and possible bonus action.

If you attack, you can't move.

If you use a maneuver that requires an action and fail the Command test, you can still simply attack as long as you haven't moved.  

After all commanders have taken their turns, check the point values of each side, if yours is *more than double your opponents', you win. (50%+1)

The round ends.
