### Cloak of Invisibility

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_  

While wearing this cloak, you can pull its hood over your head to cause yourself to become invisible. While you are invisible, anything you are carrying or wearing is invisible with you. You become visible when you cease wearing the hood. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

Deduct the time you are invisible, in increments of 1 minute, from the cloak’s maximum duration of 2 hours. After 2 hours of use, the cloak ceases to function. For every uninterrupted period of 12 hours the cloak goes unused, it regains 1 hour of duration.

**Materials**: An [[Oni]] eyelash, three pounds of [[gum arabic]], crushed crystals costing 100 gp, a bag of powdered graphite, one pound of powdered platinum, a small copper rod, a flask of [[Aboleth]] mucus, nectar from the [[Hinny]] flower, wool from a particular lamb (see instructions), rubber boots.

**Instructions**: Paint: Heat the [[gum arabic]] to melting. Add crushed crystals and powdered graphite to create a thick substance. Drop in the [[Oni]] eyelash and powdered platinum and allow the chemical process to take place. The result will be an electric-conductive paint with magical properties.

Cloak dye: Dissolve copper in [[Aboleth]] mucus (highly acidic, hence [[Alchemist’s tools]] proficiency required). Dilute with water. This will give the fibers of the cloak conductivity so that entire piece of clothing will become [[invisible]].

Cloak: Gather nectar from the [[Hinny]] flower, which only blooms on the first day of spring. Administer the nectar to a pregnant ewe within the last month of gestation (month 4). Spin the wool from the first shearing of the lamb, which takes place at 8 months. This wool will be thinner yet stronger than normal wool due to the nectar. Dye the yarn in the cloak dye and weave into a cloak.

Paint the holy symbol of [[Leira]] on the back of the cloak (clockwise swirl contained in an upside down triangle) with the electricity-conductive paint. Don the cloak and rubber boots in close proximity to [[Will-O’-Wisps]] engaged in reproduction (within 30 feet). One must wear the cloak during this process so that it does not disappear and become lost. However, the wearer must not disturb the symbol painted upon the fabric. Note that Will-O’-Wisps will attack creatures encroaching on their territory.

During Will-O’-Wisp reproduction, energy will be drawn from the [[Negative Material Plane]], and a portion will transfer to the electric-conductive cloak, activating its [[invisibility]] properties.

**Proficiencies**: [[Weaver’s Tools]], [[Alchemist’s Tools]], [[Arcana Skill]] 
**Material CR Range**: 19+  
**Cost**: 100,000 gp  
**Workweeks**: 50

**Dungeon Master Notes:** Note that this item is Legendary, so this formula will be very involved and challenging.   

The material component for the spell [Invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/invisibility) is an eyelash encased in [gum arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_arabic). From the [Bead of Force](https://www.flutesloot.com/formulas-for-crafting-popular-magic-items-in-5e/#beadofforce) formula, we can recall that gum arabic (acacia gum) is found in semi-desert region, like Pakistan or India, and is used as a binder in ceramics and painting, among other things ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_arabic#Usage)). We’ll use these spell components as inspiration and require an [Oni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/oni) (CR 7, at-will invisibility) eyelash encased in gum arabic.   

For this item, we’re taking a slight science-fiction route by explaining that the cloak’s invisibility comes from energy that conducts into the very fibers of the piece of clothing, mixed slightly with magic. Graphite and copper are electricity-conductive, and crystals store energy. 

For a more magically-inclined touch, we add that the powers of [Leira](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Leira), the goddess of illusions, via her holy symbol will also contribute to the item’s creation. With this, there is ample potential for Leira temple encounters.

We’ll also use additional monsters with inherent invisibility abilities for components. However, to reach our CR requirements, we’ll add extra challenge with this monster using Advanced Dungeons and Dragons first edition lore. Let’s take a look at the [Will-O’-Wisp](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Will-o%27-wisp) from the _Dragon Magazine Issue #99_ (pg. 19).

This issue describes an elven manuscript that warns adventurers of the Will-O’-Wisp as a “lattice of information with no material substance—a scroll with no parchment, the sage writes.” Made of crystalline energy, self-sustaining and potentially immortal, the Will-O’-Wisp possesses powers of electrical bolts, levitation, and temporary invisibility.  
  
Describing the reproduction process of Will-O’-Wisp, three must come together and join as one crystalline energy form, during which a flash of intolerable brightness emanates. When the three come together, their stats are summed. The three separate, leaving in their midst an infant boggart. “If one wished to destroy a will-o-wisp, now would be the ideal time, since the three parents are in a severely weakened state after the mating.”  
  
“While the great majority of this energy requirement is drawn from the Negative Material Plane, enough comes from the parent will-o-wisps to significantly weaken them: for the next 11-16 turns, all three are at half-normal hit points and are incapable of using their electrical powers.”  
  
A Will-O’-Wisp can shift from corporeal to non-corporeal forms and vice versa, taking on the forms of humanoid and ball of energy. Changing between the forms either consumes a large amount of energy, resulting in a lowering of temperature, or a release of energy, which raises the temperature. Each time a boggart (young Will-O’-Wisps) transforms, it grows larger, requiring more energy to shift. Some of that energy is stored and released into the [Negative Material Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Negative_Energy_plane). For this reason, Will-O’-Wisps are resistant to most magical spells and material weapons. Only spells and weapons that disturb the non-material lattice of the Will-O’-Wisp can damage it (hence the high AC).  
  
The final bit of lore about Will-O’-Wisps: “The 10% chance of encountering 1-3 will-o-wisps as outlined in the Monster Manual represents the possibility of meeting some or all of a group that is about to engage in, or has just completed, mating. If more than one will-o-wisp is encountered, there is an additional 25% chance that 1-4 boggarts are also in the area.”

From this knowledge, we can upscale the CR of the Will-O’-Wisp encounter by making them difficult to find, combined in battle, and worthy of a legendary magical item.

Note that the time required (nearly a year) for production is due in large to the amount of time needed to gather and prepare wool, plus harvesting the nectar at a specific time of year, and locating mating Will-O’-Wisps. Costs should be spread throughout the 50 weeks and pay for equipment, hiring a shepherd (possibly the largest expense) and purchasing the wool, travel expenses, and components.
