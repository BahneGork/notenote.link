### Cape of the Mountebank

_Wondrous item, rare_  

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the dimension door spell as an action. This property of the cape can’t be used again until the next dawn.

When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.

**Materials**: Water and lye (10 gallons), [[caligo]] wings (10 pairs), [[Blink Dog]] fur (50 grams), brimstone (1 pound), gold dust (GOLD COST), 15-gallon oaken barrel, silk/nylon/wool textiles, sylvan runes, hyacinth (33 flowers), adult [[faerie dragon]] cartilage (from two wings).

**Instructions**: For the cape’s trim, begin with a ten-gallon base of lye (caustic soda) and water. Grind the following ingredients and add them to the base: ten pairs of caligo (owl butterfly) wings, [[Blink Dog]] fur, brimstone, and gold dust to create a golden dye. Seal the dye in a small oaken barrel to be buried under the branches of a tree that has grown to adulthood in a consecrated graveyard or courtyard. Exhume the dye on a night with no moon. Before the next full moon rises, apply the dye to silk, nylon, or wool to be used with the cape’s trim. The trim can mostly be applied according to the taste and skill of a seamstress, except for the cape’s edges which must be sewn intricately to emulate sylvan rune-gate architecture. These runes are associated with the [[Dimension Door]] spell when it is recorded in a [[wizard’s spellbook]].

Once the trim has been dyed, it’s time to add more ingredients to the golden dye. Add hyacinth flowers and cartilage from adult [[faerie dragon]] wings. Boil the dye, at which point it will assume a new color depending on the deceased faerie dragon’s personality. If more than one faerie dragon’s cartilage is used, the dye may develop peculiar, diverse colorings, resembling a mixture of oil and water. After boiling the new dye for one month, cool it quickly (perhaps with ice). Its temperature must drop to become lukewarm, so act quickly. Make haste as you apply the new dye to the cape.
