**Materials**: Topaz gemstone costing 500 gp, three Olus Veritis mushrooms dried, fat from a Canoloth, a handful of saffron, holy water

**Instructions**: Mash together the dried mushroom, fat, and saffron. Cover the Topaz with the salve. Place in a fiery furnace for six minutes. Remove and allow to cool. Wash the gemstone with holy water. You will know the enchantment worked if the Topaz has lost its color, appearing as a clear crystal.

**Proficiencies**: Arcana or Religion skill  
**Material CR Range**: 9-12  
**Cost**: 2,000 gp  
**Workweeks**: 10

**Dungeon Master Notes:** In the 3.5e Player’s Handbook, to make a Gem of Seeing, one must be able to cast True Seeing, which requires material components of a salve for the eyes made of mushroom powder, fat, and saffron. 

We can also look for specific [gemstones](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Gems) that have a high cost. We will use [Topaz](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Topaz) for its immunity to breakage when enchanted (3.5e Volo’s Guide to All Things Magical, pg. 52). The Gem of Seeing is naturally crystal-clear, so we will conclude that the enchantment is activated when the topaz loses its coloring.

For the mushroom powder, we will require _Olus Veritis_, which may be used in compelling the truth. These mushrooms are found in the Outlands in Spring, Summer, and Fall. 

For the fat, we’ll require a piece from the hulking [Canoloths](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Canoloth) (CR 8), trusty hounds of the Yugoloth fiends, who have powers of Truesight. Add sly Canoloth tactics into your adventure using this article from [The Monsters Know What They’re Doing](http://themonstersknow.com/yugoloth-tactics-canoloths/). Because this is a fiend monster, we’ll require the gem be washed with holy water to counterbalance the evil characteristics.
