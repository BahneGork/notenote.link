### Bag of Holding

_Wondrous item, uncommon_  

This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane.

If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward’s handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

**Materials**: A large 2 x 4 ft. bag woven from material of the [[astral plane]] (such as one a [[Githyanki]] would possess, or made from the mane of a Foo Lion), a small [[jacinth]] gemstone on a chain of silver.

**Instructions**: Assemble or acquire a bag from astral plane material. Secure the chain and gem at the opening of the bag.

**Proficiencies**: [[Weaver's Tools]] if weaving the bag oneself. Otherwise, none.  
**Material CR Range**: 4-8  
**Cost**: 200 gp  
**Workweeks**: 2

**Dungeon Master Notes:** For the 9th level spell [[Astral Projection]], the material components required are one [[jacinth]] worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp. We can scale that down to fit the cost of an uncommon magic item, 200 gp.  

We will also require special material made from the astral plane. This is more to cater to the quest with CR 4-8. Though a [Foo Lion](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Foo_lion) does not have stats in 5e, perhaps it is something they could run into if they travel the astral plane themselves. They could also steal equipment from a band of [[Githyanki]] without confronting them, or perhaps by ambushing one, in the material plane.
