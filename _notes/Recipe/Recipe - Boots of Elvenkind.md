### Boots of Elvenkind

_Wondrous item, uncommon_  

While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on [[Dexterity]] ([[Stealth]]) checks that rely on moving silently.

**Materials**: Cork made of [[Duskwood]] bark, linen woven from fibers of [[Shadowtop]] trees, ashes from burned leaves of mistletoe.

**Instructions**: An elf or half-elf is required to craft these boots. Assemble the boots with cork and linen. Take the boots to [[Lake Sember]], locate the “[[Nightmare Mists]]” (detectable only by Elves and menacing to all other creatures) and dust the boots in mistletoe ash. The boots must sit in these mists overnight. Can craft 1-8 pairs of boots with the materials, cost, and time (at the discretion of the Dungeon Master).

**Proficiencies**: [[Cobbler’s]] or [[Weaver’s Tools]]  
**Material CR Range**: 4-8  
**Cost**: 200 gp  
**Workweeks**: 2

**Dungeon Master Notes:** In the Neverwinter Nights Atari game, Boots of Elvenkind were crafted for elven scouts in 884 DR (probably from the sylvan community [Elventree](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elventree)), and aided in [two major battles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Singing_Arrows) against mercenaries from [Sembia](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sembia). However, elves have been very reluctant to share the formula or sell the magic boots themselves in case they fall into the wrong hands, such as thieves or their enemies (Source: Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn).   

Thus, players should only come upon this formula as a gift from a rogue wood elf, or some other reward for their noble deeds when they prove themselves honorable to the elves. Additionally, in the 3rd edition (DMG, pg. 250), only an elf character can craft these. In terms of our formula, only an elf character can detect the [sentient mists](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Semberholme#Magical_Defenses) of the Semberholme, thus an elf is required to be in the adventuring party to create the boots.   

Befitting to the magic item’s description, we will use inspiration from the Druid spell [Pass Without Trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace), which has material components of ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce.  

As for the composition of the shoe, cork is a strong yet silent base for a shoe and can be made from bark, and linen can be woven from fibrous trees. We will use plants from [Arch Wood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arch_Wood) and [Cormanthor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormanthor) outside of Sembia.  

The lore behind the formula’s sentient mists comes from _[Semberholme (Part 1) Legend and Mystery](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rl/20060727a)_ Realmslore:

“After the Fall of Myth Drannor, among the few elf survivors were a handful of very powerful practitioners of magic. These fled to the forests around Lake Sember, where the cluster of villages collectively referred to as ‘Semberholme’ had been established thousands of years earlier as refuges for the infirm, children and their mothers, and pregnant elves. There they cast powerful High Magic spells (involving several of the casters sacrificing their lives, to in effect become ‘spirits of the mist’) to discourage non-elves from following them.  
  
“The spells altered the area’s mists and gave them powerful properties. (These near-continual mists occurred naturally when wind cooled by the Thunder Peaks reacted with the warmer water of Lake Sember. Except during gales, it’s rare to see the lake without mist clinging to at least some of its shores.)  
  
“Infused with magic, the mists became able to sense and respond to living creatures, moving to physically intercept and enshroud them—and infiltrate their minds.  
  
“Elves and half-elves could feel the magic and the awareness of the mists, but to all other minds, the mists implanted ‘don’t go here’ suggestions of menace and revulsion.  
  
“Over time, enough beings encountered the mists to earn them the name ‘the Nightmare Mists.’ They worked very effectively, though the magic faded over time. All it can achieve today is evoking in wakeful beings a vague but everpresent feeling of melancholy, desolation, and loneliness, plus fleeting frightening visions. Those who are asleep experience full-fledged nightmares.”
