### Flame Tongue

_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_  

You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword’s command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

**Materials**: Fyrite ore, four leaves of sumac, a small bag of sulfur, a small ball of bat guano, one flask of Alchemist’s Fire

**Instructions**: Grind the leaf of sumac with the sulfur and bat guano. Drop the sulfur mixture into a quenching bucket of water. Allow the mixture to dissolve in the water. Forge the Fyrite ore in the fires of the Elemental Plane of Fire and then throw the flask of Alchemist’s Fire into the bucket such that it breaks at the bottom and allows the oil to rise up to the surface of the water. Quench the sword in the bucket of water, which will have a layer of flaming oil atop.

**Proficiencies**: Smithing Tools  
**Material CR Range**: 9-12  
**Cost**: 2,000 gp  
**Workweeks**: 10

**Dungeon Master Notes:** In the Dungeon Master’s 3rd Edition Guide, Flame Tongue was created with the use of scorching ray, flame blade, flame strike, and/or fireball spells. The material components of these various spells include leaf of sumac, pinch of sulfur and a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur.

According to _Elemental Hazards: An Exploration of the Inner Planes_ (pg. 42), Fyrite is a red ore that can be forged in supernaturally hot fires upon the [Elemental Plane of Fire](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Plane_of_Fire). Fyrite weapons will be as strong as steel and immune to heat, though vulnerable to cold. This vulnerability should not be of much concern to us in creating the Flame Tongue. In this manual, we also discover that Fyrite ore may be found near the hottest substance on the Elemental Plane of Fire: cerulean magma.

To activate the flame of the sword, we will require quenching in a bucket of water that has the sulfur, guano, and leaf dissolved into it, and a layer of Alchemist’s Fire alight on the surface.

Note also that Flame Tongue can be any sword. See our [Guide to Common Swords](https://www.flutesloot.com/a-guide-to-common-swords/) for inspiration and information. For instance, the [Flame-Bladed Sword](https://www.flutesloot.com/a-guide-to-common-swords/#flame) provides unique parrying benefits and anti-grabbing properties, to add some flair to your fighting style.
