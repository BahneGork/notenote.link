### Dust of Dryness

_Wondrous Item, uncommon_  

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Materials**: A corked vial, purple dust from the Plains of Ashen Dust, sagebrush native to the Plains, water from the Grinning Skull, chalk.

**Instructions**: Upon gathering materials, burn a wand of sagebrush at the Grinning Skull. On a rocky surface, draw a circle with eight dots on its border at equal distances. Connect one dot to the remaining 7 dots.  
  
Fill the vial half with dust and half with water, uncorked, and place it on the dot connected to seven lines. Recite the following incantation:  
_‘An daan haar dur drarluuc man dekhaagaal, tuun duun dech den dron dekhaar dakhuugaar ar duulaan.’_

**Material CR Range**: 4-8

**Dungeon Master Notes:** In the 3.5e Dungeon Master’s Guide, Dust of Dryness crafting required the user to be able to cast [Control Water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/control-water), which has material components of “a drop of water and a pinch of dust.” We’ll require these components as well, but they will come from uncommon locations or sources.

There are a few desert locations of interest in Faerun, but for this item, we will focus on the [Plains of Purple Dust](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Plains_of_Purple_Dust). According to _Old Empires (1990)_ pg. 8, 

“By all accounts, though, the Plains of Purple Dust is a land as wonderful as it is terrifying. The plain floor is covered with (as one might guess) purple dust, which radiates a faint magic (though no use has been found for it). This dust constantly blows into the air, giving the sky a reddish tint. Many giant animal bones can be found on the floor of the plains. The fierce winds howl as they whip through these remains of the long-dead. Those who enter the plains must cover their mouths with a wet cloth in order to breathe.”

In this manual, there were “no uses found for” Purple Dust, so perhaps the source of the formula development was ancient, secretive, tribal, and difficult to come by, or written by a [Nezramite](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Nezram) mage native to the Plains. Remember that there are a myriad of ways to develop an item, and this is just one formula for Dust of Dryness. The water will come from the [Grinning Skull](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Grinning_Skull) oasis of the Plains, which is shielded by a large skull of a great wyrm dragon. 

Encounters in the Plains can range from pirates, mages, and nomads to young brass/brown/blue dragons and undead [Imaskari artificers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Imaskari) to ancient arcane towers or ruins. Remember to keep your CR encounters from 4-8.

Other aspects to include in your adventure to tie in the Dust of Dryness:

“There are many stories about hidden magic and wealth in the plains. The most famous is the story of the traveler who came upon the Purple Stair, an entrance to a mysterious land under the earth. This land was allegedly full of strange beasts thought long-dead. It was ruled by a race of cruel lizard people, twice as tall as normal lizard men, who wielded powerful magic. None have confirmed this legend, but the story of the Underrealm has scared many a child at bedtime.”

The incantation is a Goblin translation of “As the great wyrm dragon has withered, so too will this dust wither whatsoever it touches,” courtesy of [ScrewyTruths.com](http://www.screwytruths.com/Goblin.html). The nomadic [mongrelmen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mongrelfolk) of the Plains, who are a crossbreed of several races including goblin, could be the original developers of this Dust of Dryness formula.
