### Daernâ€™s Instant Fortress

_Wondrous item, rare_  

You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.

The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors. with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.

**Dungeon Master Notes:** In 3.5e Dungeon Master Guide (pg. 254), Daernâ€™s Instant Fortress crafters were required to know the spell [Mordenkainenâ€™s magnificent mansion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magnificent-mansion), which has material components: a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon. Additionally, Daern the Unshakeable is a hero-deity of defense and fortresses, and she was often associated with [griffins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/griffon). Weâ€™ll utilize her priests in this formula.Â Note that there is not a lot of information about Daern and her priests. Here is your chance to tie in campaign lore!  

The fortress, when activated, is built of [adamantine](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Adamantine), which is an alloy of five parts adamant, two parts silver, and one part [electrum](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Electrum), and can be found in the underdark in veins of ore. Sometimes a meteorite could be found with an amount of adamantine (Voloâ€™s Guide to All Things Magical, pg. 55-56).  

In the 1990 Forgotten Realms Adventure (pg. 130), we read that a [harbor moon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Harbor_moon) coin is made of electrum and plated in platinum. It is worth 50 gp within Waterdeep and 2 gp elsewhere. Shaped like a crescent moon, the coin has a hole punched through to allow it to be strung on a chain.  

The final ingredient in our formula is a shard of wood from a noble palace. Weâ€™ll require the shard to be from an honorable palace (the palace inhibitor should match the alignment of Daernâ€”lawful neutral). The shard should come from the structure of the palace, such as a rafter, a pillar, floor boards, etc.
