### Bead of Force

_Wondrous item, rare_  

This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads of force are found together.

You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

**Materials**: Spherical clear crystals (one per bead for 1d4+4 total beads), 8 oz [[gum arabic]] from an [[acacia]] tree, a small bag of gunpowder.

**Instructions**: Melt the gum arabic and mix in gunpowder until smooth. Coat each crystal sphere in the mixture. Allow the balls to sit in sunlight for one hour per day until the crystals have absorbed the mixture (about 6 weeks).

**Proficiencies**: [[Herbalism]] to extract the gum  
**Material CR Range**: 9-12  
**Cost**: 2,000 gp  
**Workweeks**: 10 (including 6 weeks for crystals to absorb gum mixture)

**Dungeon Master Notes:** In 3.5e Dungeon Master’s Guide (pg. 248), to craft Beads of Force, players were required the ability to cast [Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/resilient-sphere), which has material components: a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic.   

To reach your CR rating of 9-12, require your players to journey to a foreign semi-desert region (think Pakistan or India) to harvest precious gum arabic. What challenges could they face on their journey that would be comparable to fighting a [Treant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/treant) (CR 9), [Djinni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/djinni) (CR 11), or [Archmage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/archmage) (CR 12)?  

Up to 4 of the workweeks required should involve traveling to and acquiring the material components.
