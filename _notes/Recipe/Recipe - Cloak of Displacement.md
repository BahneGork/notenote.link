### Cloak of Displacement

_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_  

While you wear this cloak, it projects an Illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on Attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are Incapacitated, Restrained, or otherwise unable to move.

**Materials**: Hide of a [[Displacer Beast]], two yards of fleece, dust from an emerald costing 1,000 gp, gum arabic, soot from a [[Fey Cherry]] branch, a copper pot.

**Instructions**: Combine the [[gum arabic]], soot, and emerald dust into a paste. Mix the paste in a copper pot with a quart of boiling water. Immerse the fleece in the pot’s mixture and allow it to soak for two hours. Sew the now-shimmering black fleece into a cloak, attaching the [[Displacer Beast]] hide without.

**Proficiencies**: None  
**Material CR Range**: 9-12  
**Cost**: 2,000 gp  
**Workweeks**: 10

**Dungeon Master Notes:** In 3.5e, to craft a Cloak of Displacement, one needed to know the spell Displacement, which shifts the target of the spell 2 feet from its actual location. This spell was replaced by Blur in 5th edition, and neither require material components. However, we can produce similar effect with spells like [Minor Illusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/minor-illusion) and [Silent Image](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silent-image), which require components of a bit of fleece. [Programmed Illusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/programmed-illusion) requires jade in addition to fleece. We will require fleece to be added to the Displacer Beast’s hide to create this cloak.

We will also explore lore from the Displacer beast (CR 3), lesser known as the Dirlagraun (_The Sword Never Sleeps_, pg. 294).

From _The Ecology of the Displacer Beast_ (pg. 32), we read:

“Its name derives from its ability to appear up to a full yard away from its actual position, caused by subtle vibrations emitted from its flesh that apparently refract light to distort the beast’s apparent location.  
  
“It seems now that the molecular vibrations, stimulated by a specialized group of nerves, occur only in the outer layers of the beast’s skin cells. Where as the vibrational movement is too minute to be normally noticed, it is sufficient to bend and redirect the rays of colored light. The refracted light rays form the illusionary image while the true form is masked, virtually invisible.”  

Another piece of information we will use is the geology term [birefringence](https://www.gemrockauctions.com/learn/news/what-is-gemstone-birefringence), or the splitting of light in two separate rays at different speeds. This is a similar effect to how Displacer Beasts refract light from their skin cells to create their illusions. Rubies (5,000 gp) and emeralds (1,000 gp) are two of the most popular birefringerent gemstones. We will require a dye to be made from emeralds to give the fleece a similar refracting illusion, plus add to the enchantment.

The final bit to our formula that enchants the cloak is derived from Dragon Magazine Issue #357, pg. 56. The [Fey Cherry](https://www.realmshelps.net/magic/items/magicplants.shtml) is a tree with magical properties that produces fruit once per decade. Though limbs and leaves harvested from these trees contain no magical properties, we will still use it to create the ink to dye the fleece. The soot will create the desired black color, as per the cloak’s image in the Dungeon Master’s Guide 5e (pg. 158), and the copper pot acts as a mordant to bind the dye to the fabric.

To reach the CR requirement of 9-12, design complex encounters around defeating a Displacer Beast and retrieving wood from the Fey Cherry.
