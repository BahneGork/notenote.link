### Broom of Flying

_Wondrous item, uncommon_  

This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.

You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.

**Materials**: A broom, a ring or piece of jewelry of sentimental value to the crafter, a wing feather from any bird.

**Instructions**: Take the material components to the large agate formed in the lightning scars at the western edge of the Vast Swamp (where the Battle with Witch Lords occurred). Place the broom and jewelry on top of the agate and trace the magical pathways of the gem. The crystal formations in the agate will glow and consume the jewelry, magically creating the Broom of Flying.

**Proficiencies**: None.  
**Material CR Range**: 4-8  
**Cost**: 200 gp  
**Workweeks**: 2

**Dungeon Master Notes:** In the 3.5e DMG (pg. 251), crafting a Broom of Flying requires the ability to cast Overland Flight and Permanency. These spells no longer exist in 5e, but we can use a similar spell, [Fly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fly), as inspiration (material component: wing feather). There isn’t a spell similar to Permanency, but it brings an interesting dynamic to the formula: Permanency has an experience cost, which requires the spellcaster to give up something valuable.   

Additionally, based on the item description, it seems there is a mystic bond between the broom and the person who stands astride it and speaks the command word such that nobody else could hijack the vehicle. A spell adjacent to this effect that we could use for inspiration is [Warding Bond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/warding-bond), which has material components of two platinum rings that both the spellcaster and the target must wear for the duration. An appropriate component for crafting the Broom of Flying would be a ring or piece of jewelry of personal significance that one would give up, similar to the experience cost of Permanency, and similar to the components of Warding Bond.   

We will also use the Transmutation spell [Awaken](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/awaken) as inspiration, which has a material component of an agate worth 1,000 gp, in which you trace magical pathways to activate the spell. This magical gemstone component also capitalizes on the [notoriously witchy theme](https://www.flutesloot.com/5e-guide-to-playing-a-witch/) of a flying broomstick.  

A brief geology lesson: agate is a gemstone that is basically a rock filled with microcrystals and other mineral impurities, layer by layer, forming concentric bands or other patterns. A similar rock formation, the Fulgurite, is a natural tube of glasslike sediments that form when lightning hits the ground. Depending on the composition of the ground, other crystallization can occur. We’ll use this knowledge in our required materials.  

The last key to the formula is a bit of Faerun history from [_Cormyr: A Novel_](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_with_the_Witch_Lords) (pg. 304–311): in 900 DR, a battle took place on the western edge of the Vast Swamp in Cormyr between the Witch Lords of Wyvernwater and the Cormyreans. The Witch Lords “unleashed bat-mounted units who used lightning-based attacks.” Eventually, the Witch Lords’ armies retreated into the swamp, giving Cormyreans the victory.   

From these canonical sources, we are going to create our own lore that Dungeon Masters can implement into their campaign:  

_Twenty years ago, a drawn-out period of dryness caused the west exterior of the ever-expanding Vast Swamp to recede, unveiling the long-lost battleground of the Battle with the Witch Lords. Archeologists eagerly excavated the region and discovered a gigantic 20 ft. x 30 ft. agate formed within the scars of the earth where lightning from the bat creatures in battle struck the swampy sediment. Shimmering with streaks of turquoise, white, and rusty red, this large gem emitted mystical vibes. Before transportation crews could remove the rock, unearthly storms caused the marshes to mostly overtake the agate._

_In the notes of one of the archeologists, your adventurers have discovered instructions on using the powers of the Witch Lord battleground to create a powerful broom of flying: “Late one night, while dusting the top of the agate we uncovered, I set my tools and my wedding ring to my side, next to my broom, and began dusting the contours of the gem. A light shone from the rock, irradiating the broom. In a bright gleam, my ring disappeared, and the broom hovered between my legs. A single word whispered in the air:_ Malefica._”_
