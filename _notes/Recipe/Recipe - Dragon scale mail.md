### Dragon Scale Mail

_Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)_  

Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**Materials**: One intact scale from a young adult dragon, premium leather, web silk from a Drider, Atigax fungus, blood of a Giant (type associated with dragon scale resistance type).

**Instructions**: Dry the Atigax mushrooms for one week. Treat the web with an alchemical concoction of ground Atigax and Giant’s blood for up to four weeks. Assemble your leather and scale with the treated web thread.

**Proficiencies**: Leatherworker’s Tools, Alchemist’s Tools  
**Material CR Range**: 13-18  
**Cost**: 20,000 gp  
**Workweeks**: 25

**Dungeon Master Notes:** According to 2.5e _Draconomicon_ (pg. 5), “heavy scales cover a

dragon from the tip of its tail to [the] end of its snout,” and “a dragon has hundreds of hard, durable scales covering its body” (pg. 7).  

“A dragon’s largest scales are attached to its hide along one edge and overlap their neighbors like shingles on a roof or the articulated plates in a suit of armor. These scales cover the dragon’s neck, underbelly, toes, and tail.  The majority of a dragon’s scales are smaller and attached to the skin near their centers.”   
  
“A dragon’s scales grow throughout its lifetime, albeit very slowly. Unlike most other scaled creatures, a dragon neither sheds its skin nor sheds individual scales. Instead, its individual scales grow larger, and it also grows new scales as its body gets bigger. Over the years, a scale may weather and crack near the edges, but its slow growth usually proves sufficient to replace any portion that breaks off. Dragons occasionally lose scales, especially if they become badly damaged. Old scales often litter the floors of long-occupied dragon lairs.”

By the young adult age (51-100 years), a dragon’s scales have developed into formidable armor (pg. 13). By age 401, scales begin to show signs of aging, with chips and cracks at the edges (pg. 14). 

From this dragon ecology, we can infer that a strong material and tool will be needed to assemble the scales or hide. To assemble the armor, we will require thread from a very strong material, using [Drowsilk](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Drowsilk_(3.5e_Equipment)) (3.5e homebrew) or [Spidersilk](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spidersilk_armor) as inspiration. The crafter must concoct an alchemical reagent to bathe web from a [Drider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/drider) (CR 6) to use as thread. 

Note that Driders are drow who have been cursed by Lolth. Only half of the Drider population can produce web silk, and according to _The Drow of the Underdark_ (pg. 11), they can produce web up to ten times per day, though the silk is extremely dangerous to all but the Drider and acts like [Rope of Entanglement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/rope-of-entanglement). Use this knowledge to set up your CR 13-18 encounters. How can they handle Drider web without it attacking them? What solutions can they come up with as a party? Perhaps the formula they receive notes very little about the dangers of Drider web.

Next we will require the silk to be treated in an alchemical concoction that will stabilize the silk in daylight. The reagent will be made from the fungus [Atigax](http://www.forgottenadventures.com/FRInfo/herbspart2.htm), which removes sensitivity to sunlight, and the blood of a Giant (CR 9) whose type the dragon scale is resistant to. Giants are notoriously strong, and this concoction will give our thread stability in light, resistance to specific damage, and durability.

Canonically, there are six varieties of Giants: Hill, Stone, Frost, Fire, Cloud, and Storm. Our resistances are Acid, Lightning, Fire, Poison, and Cold. Let’s pair these together:

**Giant Type**|**Resistance**
---|---
Hill|Poison
Stone|Acid
Frost|Cold
Fire|Fire
Cloud|Cold or Lightning
Storm|Lightning

Based on DM’s guidance, multiple players may create Dragon Scale Mail simultaneously on this quest, assuming there are enough gathered dragon scales.
