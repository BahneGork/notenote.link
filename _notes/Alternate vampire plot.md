The vampire lord is wondering where his spawn dissappeared to, the family of the spawn is missing them as well. People are talking and searching, without results.

The vampire suspects something and propose the PC's to investigate the ranch, for the pressence of something otherworldly. He might comment in public how productive the ranch has become of late, filling up their warehouse much faster than anyone else. He might have heard of the fits of rage the workers exhibit on their drinking trips to town.
