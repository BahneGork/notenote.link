# Desmer's legacy
The primo rogue guild around, with the goal of protecting [[Arendur]]. After the fall of Desmer the guild fell out of the throne's good graces, but eventually grew back. 

They function like Ursia's NSA and [[The Cautier School]] functions like CIA. Both are loyal to the throne.
