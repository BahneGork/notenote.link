# Plots
[[Duke Bartolo Volantis]] went missing 3 months ago, [[Duchess Elvira Volantis]] is acting head of the house but does not consider herself worthy and refuse to do the duties of her husbond until her returns. This has resulted in the collected taxes not being handed over to the kings coffers.
	As a short term solution the king sold seats on the privy council, aka Duke titles to the guilds, to get coin in the coffers. This has stirred the bristles of the old noble regime, they do not care for "new money". As such they are both angered at house volantis and eager to topple them.
