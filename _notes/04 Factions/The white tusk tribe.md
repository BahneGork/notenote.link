Related: [[The black oak fight]]

Domain size: 1
Leader: [[Bonebreaker Dorokor]]

Bonebreaker Dorokor stands nearly 7ft tall, well respected, commands unquestioning loyalty, crafty, cunning, strategic and sophisticated in her leadership. She knows little of human diplomacy, but is very curious and has begun mimicking what little she has wittnessed. She has achieved more than any other orc bloodchief in the mountains, all other clans respect [[The white tusk tribe]].

The clan is ruled with sophisticated leadership compared to regular orc standards, strategy and crafty cunning. 

Under the leadership of Dorokor the clan has established trade with some settled tribes in [[Akacia]] which has led to them using better equipment than the other orc clans who merely scavenge.

[[Oregg Steeltwister]] was working with [[Lady Dagger]] hoping to come across clues/leads for [[The Sanguineous Oriflamme]]. He is very devoted to [[Bonebreaker Dorokor]].
