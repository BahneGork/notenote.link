**Wants:**  
Does not have much to offer in a war effort, they will point out that the Ferrier guild has couriers and flying carpets. They want them to take on more responsibility (and danger).

The Omero family secretly wants to take over the Ferrier guild and sit on all transport businesses in Arendur.

[[The Exchange]] managed by ^[The Ruby Throne](https://app.campaign-logger.com/logs/8150ab4a547d4cacaf711870f0be8655/tags/band/the%20ruby%20throne) is also something House Omero wants.

Wants to protect the [[portals]] and their warehouses more than anything else.

Fears:  
If the portals fall or their warehouses, they will stand to loose alot of wealth and political power. Until either are threatened, they are not overly interrested in war discussions.

-   suggest [[the ferrier guild]] put their resources to good use
-   suggest heavy defense of the portals and warehouses
-   value materials over people
-   Offer a job to the shadow company, find a magic item that can shield the portals and warehouses or area - what item?
