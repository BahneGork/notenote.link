# Membership
Upon becomming a member of the guild, you write in your name in the guild charter.
Duties of the membership ranks, can be overruled by adventuring as adventuring bands generally provide the realm with safety. However the guild does expect you to come running if they call upon you or your membership is revoked. As an adventurer you are expected to debrief with the guild and share all knowledge learned on your travels. You might even be tasked with gathering specific knowledge.
Each members is marked on the back of their left hand with the guild mark and their rank, with an arcane mark only guild members can see. This mark is placed by a rank 3 or 4 member, the mark also grants access various places in the city.
Maybe Rank 1 = 1st level, Rank 2 = 3rd level, Rank 3 = 5th level, Rank 4 = 7th level, Rank 5 = 9th level?

At Rank 1 you can choose to learn 1 incantation from the following list:

Elemental Aegis
Rank 1 Incantation • Abjuration, Utility (Long)
As a reaction, when an enemy within 50 feet attacks an ally,
choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

your next turn.
You raise an aegis in your ally’s defense, infusing the shield
with elemental energy to help defend against certain effects

Channeling Shield
Rank 1 Incantation • Abjuration, Utility (Short)
As a reaction, when an attack hits you or an ally you can
see within 50 feet of you, you reduce the damage the target
takes from the triggering attack by 2d10, and the next
successful attack roll you make before the end of your next
turn deals an extra 1d4 force damage.

power of a foe’s attack.

force damage after the attack is resolved.

howl to a dead sailor’s dirge. In the cacophony, you find
temporary aid.
