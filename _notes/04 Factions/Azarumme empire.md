Some 1500 years ago give or take, Vampire lords and LichQueens ruled an empire of blood and decadence. They ruled over mortal men as gods.

The nobles and wizards of [[Azarumme empire]] were obsessed with immortality and through the [[Demon God Orcus]] they found it in various different ways.

It is as of yet undiscovered how the empire fell, but various evidences of it's existence has been found, investigated and interpreted. The empire's nobility primarily conversed and wrote in [[Infernal]]. They were deadly opposed of someone they named [[The Raven Queen]].

They ruled over men, whom they looked upon as cattle and slaves.

They knew many secrets of the dead and some have theorized that the ancient city of [[Tashran]] south of [[Takarnn]] has it's roots in the Azarumme empire. Believnig that some left the empire, either as exiles or maybe an effort to expand the empire, it has yet to be revealed if any theory is correct.
